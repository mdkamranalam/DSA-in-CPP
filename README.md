# 30-Day Roadmap for Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

## Roadmap Structure:

- **Day 1-10**: Foundations (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues).
- **Day 11-20**: Intermediate (Trees, Graphs, Sorting/Searching, Hashing).
- **Day 21-30**: Advanced (DP, Greedy, Heaps, Tries) + Integration/Revivions.
- **Daily Routine:** 1-2 hours theory/codde, 1-2 hours problems, 20 min review. Weekend: Mock interviews or contests.

| Day | Topic Focus               | Key Activities                                                               |
| --- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | C++ Basics for DSA        | Review arrays, pointers, STL (vectors, pairs). Implement simple array ops.   |
| 2   | Arrays & Strings          | Multi-dimensional arrays, string manipulation. Practice rotations/reversals. |
| 3   | Arrays Practice           | Kadane's algo, sliding window. Solve 10 easy LC problems.                    |
| 4   | Linked Lists Basics       | Singly/doubly linked lists, insertion/deletion.                              |
| 5   | Linked Lists Intermediate | Cycle detection (Floyd's), merge lists.                                      |
| 6   | Stacks                    | Implement stack with arrays/linked lists. Infix to postfix.                  |
| 7   | Stacks Practice           | Next greater element, histogram problems.                                    |
| 8   | Queues                    | Basic queue, circular queue, priority queue intro.                           |
| 9   | Deques & Applications     | Sliding window max, deque implementations.                                   |
| 10  | Review Foundations        | Revisit Days 1-9, solve mixed problems. Mock timed session.                  |
